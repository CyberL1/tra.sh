## How to install it?
* [Download tra.sh](https://github.com/Indexerrowaty/tra.sh/releases/latest/download/trash).
* Allow the execution of tra.sh by running `chmod +x trash`.
* For easy access, move `trash` to one of the directories listed in your PATH. For example `/usr/local/bin`.
* Done! If you didn't mess anything up, you should be able to summon your trash can by running `trash` in your terminal.

## Does it do anything more?
Yes it does! We have this very useful feature which allows you to call somebody or something trash!

For example you are pissed off at nVidia for their proprietary drivers. This is how you can easly insult them: 
```
$ trash nVidia
```
